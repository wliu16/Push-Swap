# Push-Swap

create 2 programs: checker and push_swap

checker: run with ./checker n1 n2 .. nn or ./checker "n1 n2 ... nn", and take operations input in standard input. Display error, ko (operations didn't sort ints in a) and ok(operations sorted ints in a).

push_swap: run with ./push_swap n1 n2 ... nn or ./push_swap "n1 n2 ... nn", and show operations that sorted the numbers
Goal #1: sort 5 integers with 12 or less operations (success rate: 100%)
Goal #2: sort 100 integers with 700 or less operations (success rate: 100%)
Goal #3: sort 500 integers with 5300 or less operations (success rate: 93%)

bonus for -v flag, put -v after ./checker or ./push_swap to display stack status after each operation
