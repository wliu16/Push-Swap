# Push-Swap

create 2 programs: checker and push_swap

checker: run with ./checker [list of integers]   or   ./checker "[list of integers]"  , and take operations input in standard input. Display error, ko (operations didn't sort intergers in a) and ok (operations sorted intergers in a).

push_swap: run with ./push_swap [list of integers]   or   ./push_swap "[list of integers]"  , and show operations that sorted the numbers


Goal #1: sort 5 integers with 12 or less operations (success rate: 100%)

Goal #2: sort 100 integers with 700 or less operations (success rate: 100%)

Goal #3: sort 500 integers with 5300 or less operations (success rate: 93%)

bonus for -v flag, put -v after ./checker or ./push_swap to display stack status after each operation
